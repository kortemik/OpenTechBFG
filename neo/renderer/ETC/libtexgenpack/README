libtexgenpack v0.6.1 -- a texture compressor using a genetic algorithm library.

This is simply a very basic restructuring of texgenpack so that it can be used like a library.
Mainly just wrapping everything in a namespace (texgen), replacing printf file fprintf and a FILE*
handle, and removing globals which were used to pass all options arround for the texgenpack program.
